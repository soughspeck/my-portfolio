When I joined the company as the first designer, one of the dreams of the founders was that the product will look top-notch, and will have an outstanding UX, so one of my early goals was to establish the Design System.
</p> <p>
All of the existing system was built like a <strong>puzzle, that didn’t fit each other – different parts of the product based on different open-source design systems</strong>, such as Gogs, Semantic UI, and others.
</p> <p>
In the course of 2,5 years I single-handedly <strong>designed, documented</strong> and <strong>constantly maintained</strong> a full library of several dozen components, including adding <strong>Light and Dark Mode</strong>, after Figma introduced variables, in July 2023.
</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Planning for velocity</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
I knew I needed to be ruthlessly efficient, so I mapped out a plan to jumpstart the system:
</p> <ul> <li><strong>Audited the product</strong> for existing UI patterns and components</li> <li><strong>Benchmarked open-source systems</strong> that might save time (Carbon, Tailwind, etc.)</li> <li><strong>Defined brand tone</strong> via color, type, and spacing decisions</li> <li><strong>Validated direction</strong> with the team before going too deep</li> </ul> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Validating direction with the team</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>After researching dozens of design systems, I narrowed down two visual directions:</p> <ol> <li><strong>IBM Carbon</strong> – clean, accessible, enterprise-ready</li> <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> – leaner, more flexible</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>I mocked up sample screens using both and ran them by the team. The feedback was clear: they leaned toward the Tailwind-inspired option. With team buy-in secured, I moved ahead.</p> <img class="case-study-cover" src="/assets/design-system-tailwind-mock.png" alt="Checking direction for the Design System – Tailwind-based look and feel"> <p class="caption">Checking direction for the Design System – Tailwind-based look and feel</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Getting off the ground – quickly</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>To save time, I started with a high-quality open-source Figma library by <a href="https://cogentgene1.gumroad.com/l/unuuc?layout=profile">Gene</a> (based on Tailwind). But many components were designed for marketing sites — too large and loose for a dense SaaS platform. So I:</p> <ul> <li>Adapted proportions and spacing for app UIs</li> <li>Translated styles to variables for dark/light mode once Figma Variables launched</li> </ul> <p></p> <p><strong>Starting with this template helped me set up the atoms of the system really quickly</strong> – choosing <strong>color palette, typographic scale, sizing, elevation, breakpoints</strong> and so on – it already had React classes in their naming. </p> <img class="case-study-cover" src="/assets/design-system-atoms.png" alt="The atoms of the system"> <p class="caption">The atoms of the system</p> <p>Both of these tactics – starting from template design system and creating a sample page to check the design direction and building components for it – enabled me to jumpstart the project.</p> <p><strong>Within couple of weeks, I already had a solid foundation for my new Design System, including basic components, like buttons, icon buttons, tabs, inputs, accordions and cards.</strong></p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Growing the system organically</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>I didn’t build the full system in a vacuum. Instead, I used ongoing design work (new pages and flows) as opportunities to expand the system:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Each redesign = a new batch of components</strong></li> <li><strong>Components were refined over time based on real usage</strong></li> <li><strong>This approach let the system evolve with the product</strong></li> </ul> <p></p> <p>My guiding principles:</p> <ol> <li>Don’t reinvent the wheel</li> <li>Build on real needs</li> <li>Improve while shipping via tight collaboration with devs</li> </ol> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Implementation & hand-off</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>A successful design system isn’t just about design — it’s about adoption. For a long time, there was no front-end developer available to partner on implementation. So I:</p> <ul> <li>Thoroughly documented every decision in Figma</li> <li>Left dev notes anticipating future handoff</li> <li>Structured the system in a dev-friendly way</li> </ul> <p>Eventually, the system began to be implemented in Storybook. Over time and through several dev transitions, many of the core components were built and integrated into the product.</p> <img class="case-study-cover" src="/assets/design-system-dev-notes.png" alt="Documenting my design decisions and implementation considerations to save dev time later"> <p class="caption">Documenting my design decisions and implementation considerations to save dev time later</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Impact</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>DagsHub Design System has started to be <a href="https://dagshub.github.io/design-system/">implemented in Storybook</a>. It took a while, and several developers switching each other, but many of the components have been implemented.</p> <ul> <li>Built a foundation for scalability and future collaboration</li> <li>Enabled faster onboarding for new devs via a well-documented system</li> </ul> <p>There are many nuances that need to be re-considered for the implementation part, including naming conventions, component hierarchy and folder structure, but overall we <strong>have built solid foundation for the future work.</strong></p> <div class="stats-wrapper"> <p><span class="stats">200+</span><br>Styles + variables</p> <p><span class="stats">1K+</span><br>Component variables</p> <p><span class="stats">3+</span><br>Layout templates</p> </div> </div> <a href="/data-engine" class="link-row"> <span class="link-text">Data Management Tool for ML Engineers E2E</span> <svg class="link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"> <path d="M6 18L18 6M8.25 6H18V15.75"></path> </svg> </a> <a href="/dagshub" class="link-row"> <span class="link-text">My journey at DagsHub MLOps</span> <svg class="link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"> <path d="M6 18L18 6M8.25 6H18V15.75"></path> </svg> </a> </main>  <!-- Page content goes here --> </main> <footer> <div class="footer-row first"> <a href="assets/anna_hyatt_cv_2025.pdf" target="_blank">Download my CV</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-hyatt-design/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a> </div> <div class="footer-row second"> <p class="footer-text">aesthyatt@gmail.com</p> <p class="footer-text">052-665-66-83</p> </div> <div class="footer-row">© Designed and developed with ♥ by me.
