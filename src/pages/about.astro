        <h3>.about me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Anna, a UI/UX designer with 7 years of experience in product teams.</br> 
        I hold a B.Des. in Visual Communications from Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. </br> 
        I grew up in Moscow, and moved to Israel in my early twenties.</br>
        Passionate about the intersection of design, psychology, and technology, I strive to create digital products that are simple, intuitive, elegant, and inclusive.
        </br>
        Ultimately, I love learning and and I enjoy being part of talented teams. ðŸ™‚</br>
        Will be happy to get in touch!
