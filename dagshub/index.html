When I stepped into this role in 2022 — just before the initial AI boom of early 2023 — I entered an evolving domain with no established industry standards. AI development tools were rapidly advancing, and with that came inevitable growing pains. In many ways, I was growing alongside them. Transitioning from a structured, six-person product team at a large company to being the solo designer at a startup was both a challenge and an opportunity.
</p> <p>Key lessons I learned:</p> <ul> <li><b>Results over processes</b> – Focus on outcomes rather than rigid methodologies</li> <li><b>Iterate quickly</b> – Discard ideas that don’t work and move forward</li> <li><b>Visual storytelling drives impact</b> – Transforming abstract concepts into visuals can significantly boost sales performance</li> </ul> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Data management tool for ML Engineers</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
As we looked to expand beyond our existing features, I worked closely with the company owners to identify strategic opportunities through market and user research.
</p> <p>We discovered a major gap:</p> <ul> <li>ML Engineers needed an easy-to-use and powerful feature to visualize, query and version millions of data-points of their unstructured data</li> <li>Early feedback highlighted – all-in-one tool provides big value in a messy and diverse MLOps environment</li> <li>Need for seamless integration into current flows</li> <p></p> </ul> <p>To address this, I designed a sales demo prototype, and we validated our hypothesis through early customer feedback. From there, I conducted competitor research, stakeholder interviews, and user feedback sessions, iterating on the design. Adopting a design partnership strategy, we co-developed the feature with customers, refining it through direct insights and usage patterns.</p> <div class="stats-wrapper"><p><span class="stats">2X</span><br>customers within 6 months</p> <p><span class="stats">+7%</span><br>increase in conversion rate</p> <p><span class="stats">+20%</span><br>increase in engaged users</p> </div> <p>The Data Engine successfully launched and is continuously evolving based on feedback.

Through several iterations, we developed a solid visualization of the feature, which we then presented to clients or potential customers.</p> <p> By rapidly prototyping in Figma, leveraging my Design System, and refining concepts through iterative collaboration, I helped the company to accelerate decision-making, align stakeholders, and ensure feature viability before development — <b>saving time, reducing risk</b>, and <b>increasing the likelihood of market success</b>.</p> <video src="/assets/dagshub-experiment-table.mp4" width="100%" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> <p class="caption">Experiment table prototype</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Nurturing UX maturity in the company</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>Many times in the company, we would have discussions around features and how they should look like. Initially, I always aimed for what I believed was the most seamless UX solution. But the common response was: <em>Great in theory, but technical and time constraints mean we need a simpler, more rigid version for a quick release.</em></p> <p>So, I adapted. I designed semi-ideal solutions that balanced usability and feasibility. Early discussions were often theoretical, making it difficult to convince developers that a bit more effort could dramatically improve UX.</p> <p>The most powerful negotiation tool I discovered? <b>User recordings.</b> Watching users (especially if they were paying customers) struggle with a cumbersome flow or misunderstand an outcome was far more convincing than any argument I could make. Seeing friction firsthand turned skepticism into action. New tickets would be opened in the Product Backlog to gradually improve the UX.</p> <p>Not usability testing, not surveys, not interviews—none proved as powerful in making a point during UX discussions. <b>The "Users Watch Party" became a regular event in our weekly All-Hands meetings, providing a window for the team to see the impact of their work.</b></p> <img class="case-study-image" src="/assets/user-recordings.jpg" alt="My folder named “Users Watch Party"> <p class="caption">My folder named “Users Watch Party”</p> <p>Another initiative I started was <b>UX Updates Newsletter</b>, where I shared the latest things we shipped with a focus on UX and their product impact.
