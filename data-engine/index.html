When I stepped into my role in 2022 — just before the initial AI
            boom of early 2023 — I entered an evolving domain with no
            established industry standards. AI development tools were rapidly
            advancing, and with that came inevitable growing pains. In many
            ways, I was growing alongside them.
</p> <p>
Transitioning from a structured, six-person product team at a large
            company to being the solo designer at a startup was both a challenge
            and an opportunity.
</p> <p>Through this project, I faced two major challenges:</p> <ul> <li>
Navigating a new domain with <strong>no established UX patterns</strong> </li> <li>
Designing a foundational product experience <strong>without a clear set of requirements</strong> </li> </ul> <p></p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>How do ML Engineers work with data?</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
The Data Engine feature was initiated as a product decision to pivot
            the company’s efforts towards data management.
</p> <p>
In conversations with potential customers, we consistently heard
            that managing data was one of the most challenging components in the
            work of a Data Scientist/ML Engineer. Their current tools were
            difficult to use — often adapted from general-purpose cloud storage
            or internal scripts.
</p> <p>
Especially when they have models in production and a constant need
            to gather, curate and maintain pipelines of data for their machine
            learning projects.
</p> <p>Key challenges surfaced repeatedly:</p> <ul> <li>
Difficulty exploring large volumes of <strong>multimodal data</strong> (images, audio, tabular)
</li> <li>
No easy way to <strong>track which dataset was used in which model version</strong> </li> <li> <strong>Lack of visual tools</strong> to browse, curate, or query datasets
</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>
At the same time, the feature was new and needed to integrate
            seamlessly with other platform components such as code, experiments,
            and annotation workflows.
</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Using design prototypes to navigate the ambiguity</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
At the beginning, the definition of the feature was very broad and
            vague. Given the scale and the extensive technical effort needed, my
            questions at the initial stage of the project remained unanswered,
            both from the dev leads and product stakeholders. At that point I
            could not gather a lot of information on the details of the
            implementation too.
</p> <p>Some of the questions I had in mind:</p> <blockquote>
What kind of filters would we like to develop?
</blockquote> <blockquote>
What are the requirements for them (e.g. input-based, range-based,
            time/date based, etc.)?
</blockquote> <blockquote>
How does the metadata look like? Are there specific categories? Is
            there 1-1 relationship between the metadata field and the value?
            etc.
</blockquote> <p>
We had to move fast, and even without my questions answered, we
            needed to test our product hypothesis with potential customers.
</p> <p>
My approach was to lean on my previous experience working with
            library catalog databases and search experience (see <a href="/nli-search-system-redesign">NLI search redesign</a>), regardless of the yet-to-be defined requirements and specs, and
            refine and iterate on the way.
</p> <p>
The first design versions were <strong>mock prototypes</strong>
Thanks to the Design System <strong>Design System</strong> I established
            by that time, I was able to create them with a lightning speed.
</p> <p>
The prototypes served as both a <strong>demo for customer calls</strong> and an <strong> anchor for internal discussions </strong>. It
            helped reveal alignment gaps, technical limitations, and user
            expectations far earlier than a traditional spec.
</p> <video class="case-study-video-small" src="/assets/dagshub-first-sales-mock.mp4" width="100%" autoplay loop playsinline="">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> <p class="caption">One of the early design prototypes</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>When filters fail: an insight from domain users</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
My prototype originally featured sidebar filters — a pattern I had
            used effectively in the past. But during interviews with ML
            engineers, I noticed a misalignment.
</p> <blockquote>
“I would like to be able to write my query right here, in the search
            field: most of researches work is via programming, it will be more
            natural for them to use”
</blockquote> <p>
I realized the <strong>
filter UI model was misaligned with how our users conceptualize
              data
</strong>: as code, not categories. Instead of using common sidebar
            filters, users wanted an <strong>input field</strong>, where they
            could just type in their query! Saves so much real estate, and very
            clear.
</p> <img class="case-study-image" src="/assets/data-engine-feedback-session.jpg" alt="Customer feedback session"> <p class="caption">Feedback session with a potential customer using my prototype
</p> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Shifting to a query builder model</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
With this insight, I got back to the team, but their response was:
</p> <blockquote>
Implementation of such thing is unrealistic in a foreseeable
              future: it requires complex validation scenarios: syntax,
              formatting, etc.
</blockquote> <p>
So I got back to the drafting table and reworked the UI to reflect
            both <strong>the mental model of our users AND the technical constraints.</strong> </p> <img class="case-study-cover" src="/assets/data-engine-filters-to-query-builder.jpg" alt="Filters to query builder"> <p></p> <p>The revised interface introduced:</p> <ul> <li>
A <strong>visual query builder</strong>, allowing users to define
              SQL conditions using the UI, that would be easily translatable
              into back-end query
</li> <li>AND, OR, NOT conditions, and grouping</li> <li>
As an addition, I suggested adding a <strong>snippet with a python query</strong> (the syntax aligns with the tools ML engineers already use, enabling
              smooth integration with their workflows and minimizing context switching)
</li> </ul> <p></p> <img class="case-study-cover" src="/assets/data-engine-query-builder-components.jpg" alt="Query builder components"> <p></p> <p>
This approach preserved usability for less technical users (such as
            Annotators, for example), while offering precision and familiarity
            for experienced ML engineers.
</p> <p>Post-launch feedback confirmed we were on the right track:</p> <blockquote>
“It’s great that the query is fully translatable between UI and
            code.”
</blockquote> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Working within constraints: designing an API-first MVP</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
Our engineering capacity prioritized backend and API development, so
            the UI had to be lightweight in the first release. Much of the
            actual logic-building happened via API calls, and the frontend
            became at first visualization and query composition layer.
</p> <p>
I adjusted the design scope accordingly — defining a reduced MVP
            version that still delivered user value and provided the foundation
            for later expansion.

We onboarded several design partners who received early access in
            exchange for feedback. All converted into paying customers. I
            tracked user sessions in Amplitude and LogRocket, which helped
            identify quick wins:
</p> <ul> <li>Removed <strong>unnecessary links</strong> in dataset lists</li> <li>Improved <strong>loading and empty states</strong></li> <li>Provided <strong>responsive fixes</strong> for small screens</li> </ul> </div> <div class="case-study-section"> <h4>Outcomes and impact</h4> <section class="section-divider"></section> <p>
